PLAN OF ATTACK FOR ABI CHANGE

1. spruce up makefile to handle that inline asm - WHATEVER GOOD ENOUGH
-- list object files, build object files from rules
-- quarantine hatching?
-- add that asm to the hatching

2. add major revision info to libs, ie libvscheme1.so, libvscheme2.so
-- let vscheme select which major revision to use from cmdline

3. add 2 versions of each function, and let codegen select based on abi
-- ie VCons and VCons2

4. add 2 versions of codegen
-- incrementally test: first with calling core library
-- then with lambda functions
-- then with standard library
-- then with test apps
-- then with self hosting

5. delete old codegen
