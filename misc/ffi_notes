FFI:

High priority to change:
* Constant integer expressions are not permitted yet
* No preprocessor statements other than #pragma once

Medium priority to change:
* The only pointers permitted as return type are void*

Low priority to change:
* No structure implementations are permitted, only forward declarations
* Vanity ints are 32 bit signed. And so enums must be storable in int32

Unlikely to change:
* No inline or static definitions: all declarations must be extern & no implementations are permitted
* You may not shadow a typedef name; for example: this is illegal in the ffi C `typedef int pain; void foo(int pain);`
* VLAs are not permitted; for example: `void foo(int len, int arr[][len]);`
