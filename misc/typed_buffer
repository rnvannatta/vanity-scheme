C Pointer FFI:

typedef struct VTypedPointer {
  VTAG tag;
  unsigned offset;
  VWORD desc;
  VWORD ptr;
};

desc looks like the parser:

(pointer int)
(pointer (struct foo))

(struct bar (long-int long-int))

ptr can either be a pointer to a blob of suitable type or a foreign pointer

given a buffer view of type (pointer (struct foo)), can you pass it to a function of type void(struct foo) or just of type void(struct foo *)? How about just the latter, because passing by value is a huge undertaking. It's also a bit degenerate to automagically dereference a pointer to pass by value.

functions?

ptr-cast         ie (char*)ptr
ptr-deref        ie ptr[0]
ptr-add          ie ptr+i
ptr-diff         ie ptr1-ptr2
ptr-member       ie ptr->x
ptr-ref-member   ie &ptr->x
ptr-set-member!  ie ptr->x = y
